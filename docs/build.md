# build
if you try to build my game you must read this  
  
first download python 3.11.4.  
then use the cmd and type  
`pip install pygame`  
`pip install pyinstaller`  
then go to the folder containing `main. py`  
  
open the powershell  
Type `pyinstaller -F -w main. py` in the powershell window and press Enter
at last!  
you can see the exe file in the dist folder!
# what to do after build exe
find the folder which you want and put it in  
then copy the `assets` folder in it
